# Play the a classic word game Scrabble! 
Scrabble is a game that combines vocabulary knowledge, word formation, and strategy. The main objective of Scrabble is to create words on the game board and score points based on the letters used and their placement. There are 100 letter tiles, each with a letter and a point value. The game board is a square grid with various special squares that offer bonus points for letter or word placement.

## Gameplay:

* Players draw seven of letter tiles from a bag to start the game.
* Players take turns forming words on the game board. Words can be placed horizontally or vertically, and they must connect to existing words on the board.
* Players earn points for the letters they use, with each letter having its own point value. Special squares on the board, such as Double or Triple Letter Score, can multiply the points for specific letters or words.
* Players replenish their letter tiles after each turn to maintain a certain number of tiles on their rack.
* The game continues until all letter tiles have been used, or no more legal plays can be made. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

Scrabble involves strategic thinking and word-building skills. Players aim to use high-value letters, take advantage of bonus squares, and create longer words for maximum points.
