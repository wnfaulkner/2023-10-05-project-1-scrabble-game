        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Click 'Refill Letters' to get started. Remember to refill anytime during gameplay when you have fewer than seven letters!</li>
            <li>Click a letter in the letter tray to select it (you will see the color change when it is selected). Click any cell on the board to place the selected letter.</li>
            <li>Double-click letters to remove them from the board and put them back in your letter tray.</li>
            <li>The first play must be horizontal and cover the center board square. All plays must be in only one row or one column (horizontal or vertical, no diagonal plays). All plays must be connected to at least one letter that was on the board when the play began.</li>
            <li>Once you are ready, click the 'Submit Play' button. Your play will be scored and the turn will pass to the other player.</li>
            <li>If you feel that there are no legal plays to be made and do not want to exchange letters (or if there are no letters left in the bag to exchange), you can pass your turn by clicking the 'Pass Turn' button. Any letters you placed on the board during the play will be returned to your tray and you will not receive any points for the play.</li>
            <li>Anytime you have letters in your tray, you can choose to exchange instead of playing a word. Click the 'Exchange Letters' button. Then select any letters Any letters you placed on the board during the play will be returned to your tray and you will not receive any points for the play.</li>
            <li>Once all letters are gone from the bag and some player plays all of their letters, the game ends. When the game ends, all points from letters that have not been played will be deducted from the final score of the player with those letters. The total points of all unplayed letters will be added to the score of the player who is out of letters to produce the final score for the game. The Scrabble player with the highest score after all final scores are tallied wins!</li>
